What is clarity?

Clarinet is a command-line tool that includes a Clarity runtime, aimed at simplifying the development, testing, and deployment of Clarity smart contracts. It features a Clarity REPL and a testing framework, enabling developers to quickly build and test their contracts without requiring deployment to a devnet or testnet.


Clarity itself is a smart contract language built for the Stacks blockchain, designed with a focus on predictability and security. It allows developers to encode critical business logic directly on the blockchain, ensuring a clear and reliable execution of contracts.
